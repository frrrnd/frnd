                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>My name is Fernando Soares, a self-taught designer with 13 years of experience.</p>
                
                <p>Driven by curiosity, it all started when I was 12 years old. I learned the basics of HTML by writing tags in Notepad, saving them as .htm files, and viewing them in the browser. In the same way, I learned to design for the web using Fireworks, slicing layouts to turn them into web pages. </p> 
                    
                <p>In almost all my jobs, I worked on both design and coding, but now my focus is on design. I have also built websites, blogs, e-commerce sites, etc., using WordPress.</p>

                <p>I believe that my knowledge of Front-End development helps me design real-world interfaces and solve problems with a holistic view of the product.</p>
