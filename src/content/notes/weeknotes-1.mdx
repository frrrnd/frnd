This is the first post in my new Weeknotes series. It's a personal collection of things I've found interesting and worth sharing (and to practice my English). Consider it  a quiet space to share what I've unearthed .

## This website
I redesigned this website (again). Now I think I've found the balance I wanted between a personal website and a portfolio. 
Inspired by the 2012 dribbble design trend, with gradient backgrounds and blurs, I loved how well the index page turned out. I didn't want to use video or WebGL, so I used SVG and CSS to create and animate the gradients. For the noise filter, I used  `<FeTurbulence>` .

## Listening
This week, my hyperfocus was on Mastodon, one of my favorite bands. [Crack the Skye](https://open.spotify.com/album/2cyPixuhzJiiOzTClfodlN?si=HUYpw8n_Qiuxvk_cKKFt_g) and [The Hunter](https://open.spotify.com/album/1PadLnQYelMqqSlPbSEWZ1?si=HtNw7keYQsu03AZlkScZHQ) are the albums I listened to the most. Do yourself a favor and listen to [Jaguar God](https://open.spotify.com/track/7lGOFEVWK0jzpLMFuR4ANh?si=26d15d8731b14712).

This cover is a wooden sculpture titled _Sad Demon Oath_ by the incredible [AJ Fosik](https://www.instagram.com/ajfosik/).

**Update:** As I was writing this post, the news broke that former guitarist Brent Hinds has passed away. Rest in peace, Brent.

## Creating
Portra is my favorite analog film. So, this week I sat my ass down and tried to recreate the Portra look in figma. With some adjustments to the photo and mixing some layers with blend modes, the results are really good.

It was a fun experiment and I will use in the future.

## Discovering
[Inspiraggio](https://www.youtube.com/@inspiraggio) — a YouTube channel dedicated to analyzing paintings and other topics related to art. It's very interesting to see the concepts and the details and how fascinating art can be.

## Playing
Played the Battlefield 6 beta. Even as a beta, it's waaay better than BF 2042. I enjoyed the game, but FPS games don't grab me anymore. I don't know. For now, I will stick with [Scum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/513710/SCUM/).
