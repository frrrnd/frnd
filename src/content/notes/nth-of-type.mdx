`nth-of-type` is a pseudo-class that selects elements based on their position among *siblings* of the same type (tag name).  

### Syntax  

`:nth-of-type(<an + b> | even | odd)`  

### Example  

```html
<div>
    <div>This div doesn't count.</div>
    <p>First paragraph.</p>
    <p class="color">Second paragraph.</p>
    <div>This one doesn't count either.</div>
    <p class="color">Third paragraph.</p>
    <p>Last paragraph.</p>
</div>
```  

```css
/* Odd paragraphs */

p:nth-of-type(2n+1) {
    color: red;
}

/* Even paragraphs */

p:nth-of-type(2n) {
    color: blue;
}

/* First paragraph */

p:nth-of-type(1) { 
    font-weight: bold;
}

/* Selects the third paragraph matching both 2n+1 and the 'color' class.  
The second paragraph has the 'color' class but doesn't match 2n+1. */

p.color:nth-of-type(2n+1) {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```
