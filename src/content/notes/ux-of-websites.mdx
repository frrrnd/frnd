Some points about common website UX errors and how to improve them.

## Common Errors
### PowerPoint Layouts
Sliders with full-screen images. Some might find it creative and fun, but in reality, there are several complications. A website's homepage should have **content**, which is difficult to fit in this type of layout that usually consists of just a background image with an overlaying phrase.

### Sliders
Sliders have horrible click-through rates. A website is a website, not a slideshow presentation.
If you have relevant content to put on your website's homepage, why hide it with a slider? Present content in an easy way for your user, don't make them dig to discover it. Oh, and they [hurt SEO.](https://www.gobluemedia.com/blog/image-sliders-seo/)

### Content
Have relevant content to present to the user. The homepage is the gateway for them to become your client.

## Good UX
### Layout
Your website's homepage should answer 3 basic questions right at the first fold:
- Who you are
- What you do
- And how you can help

By answering these 3 questions, the chances of the user scrolling through the site to see the rest of the content are high.

### User Journey
To convert a user or make them contact you, the page should show who you are and what you do, show that you know what you're doing and why you should be chosen, leading them to conversion or product sale.

### Consistency
Use common design patterns that the user is already accustomed to. Logo on the left, navigation menu at the top, CTA in the upper right corner for quick conversion, etc. Create a familiar experience. Standardize.
