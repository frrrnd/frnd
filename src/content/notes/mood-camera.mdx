I've always been fascinated by analog photos. The aesthetics with vivid colors and graininess, given a good nostalgic feeling. For this reason, I always looked for apps that simulate analog camera filters, until one day I found the perfect one: <a href="https://mood.camera" target="_blank">mood.camera</a>.

It's not an editing app but a camera. The core concept of the app is that you choose a filter and start taking photos. It doesn't have a preview, resulting in an experience similar to analog cameras.

The filters are inspired by analog cameras filters, such as Portra, Chrome, Gold, etc. In addition, you can adjust the quality (grain) and tone of the filter. It also has modern camera app settings like grid, flash, ratio, portrait mode, etc.

The app is free for 7 days, and after that, the filter becomes random with no option to choose. After the 7 days, full access can be unlocked with a $1.99 monthly susbscription or a one-time purchase of $14.99. I found it affordable for such an amazing app.
