This week's been calm, rainy and cold. New projects are on the way, and I'm excited.
Also trying to cut down on coffee and cigarettes — it's hard, but it has to be done.

*Nicki doing nothing*

This post has a little color system of its own. I can set 4 colors for each post (if I want) and just swap the CSS variable values.

Frontmatter:
```yaml
colors:
  backgroundColor: "106, 76%, 3%"
  textColor: "146, 24%, 70%"
  linkColor: "0, 69%, 58%"
  headingColor: "0, 69%, 58%"

```

CSS:
```css
:root {
    --backgroundColor: ${backgroundColor};
    --textColor: ${textColor};
    --linkColor: ${linkColor};
    --headingColor: ${headingColor};
  }
```

I think this adds personality to the post, and I can have fun experimenting with colors. I hope you enjoy it!

## Little Wins
[Viewport UI](https://viewport-ui.design) — a project by me and [Eryc](https://eryc.cc) — was featured in the [sidebar.io](https://sidebar.io/) newsletter. Feels so good when a side project gets some love. We’re also working on a new Astro layout to make it smoother and shinier.

## Listening
Lately, I've been listening to a lot of Nu Metal, including [Mudvayne](https://open.spotify.com/track/15TzkwxGNvM3RGib0YkH4T?si=7ebe9000940b4625), [Static X](https://open.spotify.com/track/6JUuxEQ47lJH3qfPf5nlil?si=f5e1e0d373e1441e), and especially [Deftones - private music album](https://open.spotify.com/album/1gmWnG5TeRj91Tdm2lpEvJ?si=mXbCzX7rQXeIflYbcCNRoA).

Through youtube shorts, I discovered this song by **Pantera**. I'm not a big fan of Pantera, but this track has one of the most beautiful solos I've ever heard. It starts at 3:35.

## Reading

Slowly flipping through [Tales from the Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_the_Loop) by [Simon Stålenhag](https://www.simonstalenhag.se/), one of my favorite artists. He mixes retro sci-fi with countryside vibes, which somehow feels nostalgic even if you’ve never lived in the Swedish countryside (or the ‘80s).*Tales from the Loop* is amazing — go check it out.

## Games
Still stuck on *Scum* but I want to try the new [No Man's Sky Voyagers update](https://www.nomanssky.com/voyagers-update/). I have about 300 games in my library, but I always end up  playing the same ones.
