I've been sick this past week. The days felt suuuper slow, like time itself was sick too.

## Blender
Been messing around in Blender making wallpapers. With just a single plane and some cloth physics, you can get a ridiculous amount of wallpapers — all you have to do is move the camera, spin the object a bit, and voilà: instant artsy shots. Everything’s rendered in Cycles and it’s really quick.

## Listening
All Them Witches — bluesy riffs, cosmic vibes, neo-psychedelic doom rock. Desert dust + space helmets.

## Monument Valley 2
Played a bit of MV2. The art direction is stunning — every level looks like a piece of architecture you’d want to hang on your wall. This game is so relaxing and absolutely beautiful.
