In addition to visual differences, light and dark mode interfaces differ in readability and are often defined by personal preference. Each mode offers specific advantages that may suit different situations and preferences. The choice should consider the context of use.

## Light Mode

- **Easy daytime reading:** Light backgrounds are ideal for reading in well-lit environments.  
- **Familiarity:** Users are accustomed to light mode, as it has been the default for most interfaces.  
- **Energy consumption:** On LCD screens, light mode may consume less energy than dark mode.  
- **Mood and creativity:** Light mode can positively impact mood and creativity. Bright light can stimulate alertness, an important factor for those working long hours.  

## Dark Mode

- **Reduced eye strain:** In low-light environments, dark mode reduces screen glare.  
- **Energy efficiency:** On OLED or AMOLED screens, dark pixels consume less energy than light ones.  
- **Aesthetics:** Many users appreciate the modern look of dark interfaces.  
- **Focus and productivity:** By reducing emitted light, dark mode can enhance focus, especially for those working at night or in dimly lit spaces.  

Whenever possible, offer both options. Allow users to choose based on their preferences.
