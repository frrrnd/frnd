We live believing that having more options is always better, as it gives us a sense of control over our lives. However, as the number of options increases, a peculiar phenomenon begins to manifest - the paradox of choice.

The paradox of choice was initially proposed by psychologist <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Schwartz_(psychologist)">Barry Schwartz</a> in his book <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Paradoxo-Escolha-Barry-Schwartz/dp/8577190196">The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less</a>. While an abundance of options might seem advantageous, in reality, it can leave us more dissatisfied and anxious. When we have a large number of choices, we feel increasing pressure to make the "right" decision. This pressure can result in analysis paralysis, anxiety, and even regret after the choice is made.

One of the reasons why the paradox of choice arises is **cognitive overload**. The more options we have, the more time and effort we need to invest in evaluating each one. In terms of UX and design, this is exactly what <a target="_blank" href="https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/">Hick's Law</a> states. The number of options can lead to constant comparison and fear of making the wrong decision, and as a result, we can feel overwhelmed and exhausted, making decision-making even more difficult.

Another aspect of the paradox of choice is the expectation of maximization. When we have many options, the tendency is to seek the best possible option. However, this **relentless** pursuit of perfection can leave us dissatisfied with any choice we make. There will always be a feeling that we could have chosen something better if we had explored more options. This constant dissatisfaction can lead to decreased happiness and overall satisfaction with our decisions.

Although living with infinite possibilities might seem good, the paradox of choice reminds us that there is a limit to the amount of choices we can effectively process. Finding a balance between freedom of choice and avoiding overload can be challenging, but there are strategies we can adopt. Limiting the number of options, setting clear selection criteria, and trusting our intuition are some ways to reduce the negative effects of the paradox of choice. By recognizing this, we can make more informed decisions and enjoy satisfaction in our choices.
