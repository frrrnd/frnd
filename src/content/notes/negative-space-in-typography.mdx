Negative space in typography must be handled with great care.
Headings are always read first and are usually larger than the accompanying text.

In the image below, the heading appears to belong equally to both paragraphs, above and below.

<figure>
    <ImageZoom client:load src="/uploads/images/notes/en-fig-1.png" alt="Figure 1" />
</figure>

By increasing the distance from the paragraph above, it becomes clearer which section the heading belongs to.

<figure>
    <ImageZoom client:load src="/uploads/images/notes/en-fig-2.png" alt="Figure 2" />
</figure>

The same principle applies when the layout is more complex:

<figure>
    <ImageZoom client:load src="/uploads/images/notes/en-fig-3.png" alt="Figure 3" />
</figure>

By increasing the space around the sidebar, it becomes evident that it is separate from the adjacent section.

<figure>
    <ImageZoom client:load src="/uploads/images/notes/en-fig-4.png" alt="Figure 4" />
</figure>

Negative space is a powerful tool for guiding the userâ€™s eye through the content and ensuring the right message is conveyed.
