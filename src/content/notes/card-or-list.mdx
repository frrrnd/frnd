It all depends on the context of the information.

Cards and lists are two common ways to organize information on a page. The choice of which to use depends on the situation and which one offers the best experience. The designer's role is to understand the context to make the most suitable choice.

## List

A list is essentially a page/component with multiple entries or items that match the user's search criteria.

Lists are ideal when you need to display several items with information that must be visually scannable, such as a user table containing details like name, email, phone number, etc.

## Card

A card is a container of related information that provides a summary. It serves as an entry point to more detailed information. Cards gained popularity with Pinterest, and since then, major companies have adopted this style.

They work best when the goal is to give a summary of content, encourage further exploration, and include more visual elements, like an image.


Thereâ€™s no right or wrong choice, but one of the options will better meet your objectives. The key is to carefully consider your choice.
