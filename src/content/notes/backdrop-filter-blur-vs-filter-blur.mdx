Just like in Figma, in CSS we have two properties to apply *blur* to elements.
Although they produce the same effect, they differ in their applications.

## backdrop-filter: blur

This property adds blur to the **background** of an element. The elements inside the parent element are not affected by the changes. The element needs to be transparent or partially transparent for the effect to work.

CSS syntax:

```css
.element {
	backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
}
```

In figma: 

```html
Effects > Background blur
```

## filter: blur

The `filter: blur` applies the effect to the entire element, including its child elements. It is commonly used for images and SVGs with the `<feGaussianBlur>` tag.

CSS syntax:

```css
img {
	filter: blur(10px);
	filter: url(#blur); /* embedded SVG */
	filter: url(folder/file.svg#blur); /* svg externo */
}
```

In svg:

```html
<svg role="none">
	<filter id="blur">
		<feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="10" edgeMode="duplicate" />
	</filter>
</svg>
```

In figma:

```
Effects > Layer Blur
```

These effects can cause confusion during the hand-off from Figma to code. Using them correctly ensures there are no differences in the final element.
