## Comic Mono

A legible monospace font… the very typeface you’ve been trained to recognize since childhood. This font is a fork of [Shannon Miwa](https://github.com/shannpersand)’s [Comic Shanns](https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns) (version 1).

## Agave

Agave was an attempt at making a small, monospaced, outline font that would be geometrically regular and simple.
