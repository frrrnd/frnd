Psychology plays a very important role in user experience design.
As designers, we can use certain principles to influence **(in the right way)** user behavior so that products effectively achieve their objectives.

## Hick's Law
The time a user takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
- Minimize choices when there is critical decision-making time.
- Break complex tasks into small steps, reducing cognitive load.
- Avoid highlighting elements that aren't important for the current task.
- Don't oversimplify to the point of removing important information.

## Cognitive Load
The total amount of mental effort being used in a person's working memory.
- Avoid visual clutter with unnecessary elements.
- Create experiences based on existing mental models. Design patterns that the user has encountered before.
- Eliminate user effort when the product can be smarter and do it alone. Ex.: a form that asks for ZIP code and the product fetches the rest of the location information.

## Von Restorff Effect
Or *The Isolation Effect,* when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is the easiest to remember.
- Important information and actions visually highlighted.
- Avoid elements competing visually with each other to ensure there's no confusion.
- Don't use only color to differentiate, remember colorblind users.
- Use animations moderately.

## Serial Position Effect
Users tend to remember the first and last items in a list better.
- Less important items go in the middle of lists, as they tend to be stored in memory less frequently.
- Important elements positioned on the left or right in components, like an app's navigation menu.

## Visual Perception
This is where the famous **Gestalt Theory** comes in. It states that our brain processes information in a way that the subconscious groups separate objects to understand them as a whole.

### Similarity
The law of similarity states that similar objects will group together.

### Proximity
Elements close to each other are perceived as a group and multiple distinct objects close together are seen as one thing.

### Continuity
Flow of a composition. When elements of a composition maintain fluidity from beginning to end.

### Prägnanz/Simplicity
Elements seen in the simplest form to be more easily assimilated.

### Closure
Even if an image is incomplete, our brain fills in the missing parts making us perceive it as whole.

### Unity
An incomplete image can be understood as complete. Empty spaces are filled instinctively.

### Unification
An object formed by multiple units can be harmoniously symmetric or not. It's identified when prägnanz, proximity, unity, and similarity have equal weights.

### Segregation
The brain's ability to differentiate or highlight objects, even when overlapped. Includes the variation in form and aesthetics that one element has compared to another.
