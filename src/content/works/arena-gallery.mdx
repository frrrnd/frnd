## Overview

Arena Gallery is a minimalist web app that displays Are.na channels as grid galleries. Built using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, it supports both public and private channels. The interface is clean and distraction-free, providing users with a seamless and visually focused browsing experience.


## Role 

I designed and developed the entire UX/UI of the app, focusing on simplicity and usability. My goal was to create a straightforward interface that highlights content without distractions, ensuring smooth navigation and quick access to channels for all users.
