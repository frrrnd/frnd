## Overview

Acreage is a custom launcher built for a private ArchAge server. Designed to simplify access for both new and returning players, it streamlines the setup process and enhances the overall experience of connecting to the game.


## Role

I was responsible for the UX/UI design of the launcher. My goal was to create a clean and intuitive interface that made it easy for users to install, update, and launch the game with minimal friction. I focused on usability, visual clarity, and accessibility to ensure a smooth experience for all types of players.
