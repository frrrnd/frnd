LivePix is a donation tool for content creators who stream live. It allows viewers to support streamers by scanning a QR code displayed on the screen, sending both text and audio messages along with their donation. The platform makes audience interaction more engaging while supporting monetization in a seamless way.


## Role 

I designed a landing page concept tailored to LivePix's core audience of streamers and digital creators. My goal was to position the product as a more professional, trustworthy tool while keeping the interface fun and creator-friendly. I focused on UX/UI design, visual strategy, and layout to clearly communicate the product's value and improve its appeal to potential users.
