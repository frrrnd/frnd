    **Espresso Desk** is a guide to finding the best cafés for working. An online hub that functions as a collaborative platform, giving users a voice to share and discover new inspiring spaces.

    With the recent addition of the rating system, users can now trust even more in the quality and usefulness of the information. Each listed café offers a full range of details, from internet speed to the brightness of the environment, the number of available outlets, and photos of the location. Additionally, users will find crucial location information to make the journey to the perfect café easier.

    Espresso Desk was designed to help find the ideal place to work and get inspired, whether you're a digital nomad, a student, or a professional looking for a productive and welcoming environment.
