BitPouch is an intuitive crypto wallet designed for both beginners and experienced users. It offers market tracking, sending and receiving payments, buying and trading cryptocurrencies, and NFT storageâ€”all wrapped in a minimalist 8-bit visual style. The app combines simplicity and security to deliver a seamless user experience.


## Role 

I was responsible for the UX/UI design, focusing on creating an approachable and clean interface that balances functionality with a playful aesthetic. My work included designing user flows for transactions, market monitoring, and NFT management, ensuring the app feels secure yet easy to use.
