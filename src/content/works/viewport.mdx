Viewport UI is a curated collection of inspiring UI designs, featuring apps, websites, motion graphics, and icons. Together with my friend <a target="_blank" href="https://eryc.cc">Eryc</a>, I manage the selection process to showcase high-quality work that fuels creativity in the design community. Users can also contribute by submitting their own designs through the Viewport X profile. The project is steadily growing and gaining recognition within the UI community.


## Role 

I co-manage the curation and overall UX/UI of the platform, focusing on creating a smooth and engaging browsing experience. My work includes designing user flows for submissions and refining the interface to make it easy for the community to discover and share inspiring designs.
