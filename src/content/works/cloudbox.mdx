CloudBox is an internal digital asset manager designed to help teams organize, search, and manage files more efficiently. Built specifically for company-wide use, it streamlines collaboration and ensures assets are always easy to find and use.


## Role 

I’m responsible for the UX/UI and the design system of the platform. I worked closely with stakeholders to define user flows, create wireframes and prototypes, and develop a scalable design system to ensure consistency across the entire product.
