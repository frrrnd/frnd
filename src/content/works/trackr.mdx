Trackr is a concept app designed for watchOS to help users monitor outdoor workouts like running, walking, or other speed-based exercises. It displays your real-time location on a map during the session and, at the end, provides detailed performance insightsâ€”including session duration, distance, calories burned, average heart rate, and comparisons with previous days.


## Role 

I led the UX/UI design of the app, focusing on creating a clean and easy-to-read interface for small screens. I designed interactive graphs, map visualizations, and workout summaries that prioritize clarity and motivation. The goal was to deliver a smooth, focused experience that supports users during and after their training sessions.
