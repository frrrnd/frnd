LogCMS is an internal content management system focused on writing and publishing articles. It includes a custom dashboard that tracks performance metrics such as page views, top-performing content, active users, and other detailed statistics â€” giving teams the insights they need to improve engagement.


## Role 

I was responsible for the UX/UI design of the platform. I designed user flows for content creation and analytics, and built a clean, intuitive dashboard experience. My focus was on usability, data visualization, and ensuring that writers and editors could manage and monitor their content effortlessly.
