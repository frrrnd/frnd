This project is a conceptual redesign of Spotify tailored for Apple’s VisionOS. It adapts the familiar Spotify experience to the spatial computing environment, aiming to leverage immersive interactions and provide users with an intuitive and engaging music experience in augmented reality.


## Role 

I led the UX/UI design, focusing on creating interfaces optimized for VisionOS’s unique interaction patterns. My work included designing spatial layouts, navigation flows, and visual elements that enhance usability while maintaining Spotify’s brand identity in a new, immersive context.
