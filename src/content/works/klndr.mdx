## Overview

I developed an icon for the Arc browser inspired by the synthwave style of the 80s, available in both light and dark modes. The chrome design reflects a nostalgic and futuristic aesthetic, aiming to create an emotional connection with users.


## Role 

I was responsible for the icon design, from research to creating versions for different modes. I worked on the color palette and textures, ensuring a cohesive and appealing result, with iterations based on user feedback.
